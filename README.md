## GO INSTALLER.

I have created this script to help me install and setup **GO** on linux.
The script basically does all that is needed to setup **GO**

*Overview*
The Go Installer Script automates the process of downloading and installing the Go programming language on Linux systems.

## Installation
To install Go using the installer script, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shadmeoli/go_installer/master/install_go.sh | bash -s -- --setup
```
